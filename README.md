# ivlib

This is a helpers lib I developed over the years to work with jupyter notebooks. Probably not useful to anyone except me. 

I am the only author of it. You are free to use it under the AGPL terms. Additionally, if you are a client of my freelance activity (IV-devs) and this lib is used in one of the works I delivered to you, consider that you are free to use it under the same conditions as if it were public domain or CC-0, at your convenience.
